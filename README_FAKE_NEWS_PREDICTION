# Fake News Prediction using Logistic Regression 📰🔎

This project aims to tackle the pervasive issue of fake news by developing a robust prediction model. Leveraging the power of machine learning, specifically Logistic Regression, this project empowers users to identify potentially misleading news articles. 

## Project Overview

The project follows a systematic approach to building and evaluating the prediction model:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - A dataset of news articles, labeled as either "real" or "fake", is utilized.
   - The dataset undergoes rigorous preprocessing, including:
     - Cleaning: Removing irrelevant characters and symbols.
     - Stemming: Reducing words to their root form for consistency.
     - Stop Word Removal: Eliminating common words that do not contribute significantly to the meaning.
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - The preprocessed text data is transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. 
   - TF-IDF assigns weights to words based on their importance within a document and across the entire dataset, enabling the model to capture the essence of the text.
3. **Model Training**:
   - A Logistic Regression model is employed as the core prediction engine.
   - The model is trained on a portion of the dataset, learning patterns and relationships between the features and the news labels.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The trained model's performance is rigorously assessed using the accuracy score metric.
   - The accuracy score quantifies the model's ability to correctly classify news articles as real or fake.
5. **Predictive System**:
   - A user-friendly interface is implemented, allowing users to input a news article.
   - The model processes the input and predicts whether the article is likely to be real or fake.

## Key Features ✨

* **Data Preprocessing**: Ensures clean and consistent data for optimal model performance. 🧹
